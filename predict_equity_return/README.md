# Introduction

This directory contains source code for the models predicting equity returns. 

1. batch_unified_full.m is the entry file. It generates training, validation, testing datasets, and evaluates models. This file calls load_table, load_params, generate_train_val_test_ranges, generate_train_val_test and unified_run.

2. load_table.m loads the stock dataset.

3. load_params.m specifies the configurations (such as the universe we use) and hyper-parameters. 

4. generate_train_val_test_ranges.m and generate_train_val_test.m produce training, validation, and test dataset.

5. unified_run.m runs algorithms and gets results. Set variable "mode" to test different methods.

6. The scan_params_in_algorithm folder contains the scripts to scan parameters for each algorithm (ARRR, Ridge, low-rank ridge, Lasso, Nuclear norm, RRR)

7. The algorithm folder has the implementation of all the methods. Our algorithm is implemented in f_adaptive.m

## Dataset:
Our dataset is purchased from 3rd party vendors. They are available in major platforms such as quandl. We are prohibited from re-distributing the data. Here, we provide a sample data to illustrate the format of our input in sample_stock.mat. 
Below describe the variables appeared in this file. 
base_date is the list of dates. We extracted 100 trading dates in 2010, from 20100104 to 20100601 and sampled 300 stocks.
For example, M_aret10d(300*100) is the matrix of the past 10-day return matrix. Each row represents a stock and each column represents a trading day. The corresponding stock ids are in base_equity(300*1) and the corresponding dates are in base_date(100*1). M_dv(300*100) is the dollar volume matrix.

## Running the code:
batch_unified_full('override_params_keep_csi500train_years2mode2test_months12')
For PC: Test for batch_matlab.py to run batch_unified_full use multiprocess. 
python batch_matlab.py  --mode [2] --keep_csi [300ï¼Œ800]  --train_years [1] --test_months [3]
We run the experiments in a batch job environment (TORQUE) with more than 100 cores using script call_batch.py and run.pbs
Public packages:
For the Newey-West function in the evaluate_predy.m, we used the package from  
https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41275-newey-west-standard-errors?focused=3810088&tab=function
For nuclear norm solver, we used the NNLS package [1].  
The package is available at https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/softwares/nnls/
